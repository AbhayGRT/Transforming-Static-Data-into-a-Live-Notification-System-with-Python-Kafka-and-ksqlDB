Transforming Static Data into a Live Notification System with Python, Kafka, and ksqlDB
Overview
Explore the world of live notifications by building a dynamic system that transforms static data into real-time updates. This project leverages Python, Kafka, and ksqlDB to bring data to life, with a focus on YouTube's REST API as a static data source.

Getting Started
Clone the Repository
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

```
Configure API Keys
Obtain API keys for YouTube, Kafka, and Telegram. Configure these keys in the project.

Setting Up the Environment
Create Kafka Cluster
Set up a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud to act as the central data streaming platform.

Create ksqlDB Cluster
Establish a ksqlDB cluster in Confluent Cloud to process and analyze data with SQL-like queries.

Schema Registry
Deploy a separate cluster for Schema Registry to manage schema evolution and compatibility.

Data Processing and Streaming
Define Queries in ksqlDB
Define and execute ksqlDB queries to process incoming data, identify important changes, and generate alerts.

API Endpoint Configuration
Configure API endpoints for YouTube's REST API to fetch and process static data.

HTTPS Connection Setup
Establish a secure HTTPS connection for data transmission between your application and external APIs.

Configuration Setup
Configure the application with necessary credentials, API keys, and connection details for Confluent Cloud and other services.

Running the Application
Run Main Application (youtube_watcher.py)
Execute the main application (youtube_watcher.py) to initiate the data fetching, processing, and streaming into Confluent Cloud.

Monitor ksqlDB Output
Monitor the output of ksqlDB queries to observe real-time changes and updates based on the processed data.

Telegram Integration
Telegram Bot Integration
Set up a Telegram bot and configure the application to push live, custom notifications to Telegram based on the identified changes.

Observing Transformations
Reflect on Changes
Observe and analyze how the static data from YouTube's REST API transforms into real-time alerts and notifications through the entire pipeline.
